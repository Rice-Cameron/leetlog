# LeetLog

**Live Demo:** [https://leetlog-livid.vercel.app/](https://leetlog-livid.vercel.app/)

A modern full-stack application for tracking LeetCode problem-solving progress with advanced database safety features and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Problem Tracking**: LeetCode problems with difficulty, categories, and complexity analysis
- **Advanced Database Management**: Multi-environment system with production safety locks
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Vitest + isolated test database with 100% passing tests
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, Neon PostgreSQL
- **Production Ready**: Deployed on Vercel with CI/CD and database migrations

## Tech Highlights

- **Backend**: Next.js 15 App Router, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Authentication**: Clerk with webhook-based user management
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, database isolation
- **Database Safety**: Multi-environment protection, confirmation prompts, automatic detection
- **DevOps**: Vercel deployment, environment management, schema migrations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Rice-Cameron/leetlog.git
cd leetlog
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.copy .env
# Edit .env with your database URLs and Clerk keys

# Start development
npm run dev

# For local webhook testing (Clerk webhooks)
# In a separate terminal, run webhook forwarding to port 3000
npx ngrok http 3000
# Make sure to update the webhook endpoint in your clerk console to the new forwarding domain if you are using the free ngrok version
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## Database Safety System

LeetLog implements a sophisticated `DATABASE_MODE` system to prevent accidental production data loss:

```bash
DATABASE_MODE=1  # Development (default)
DATABASE_MODE=2  # Production (protected)  
DATABASE_MODE=3  # Testing (isolated)
```

**Safety Features:**
- Production operations require explicit confirmation
- Tests automatically use isolated database branch
- Multiple validation layers prevent cross-environment contamination
- Runtime checks with detailed logging

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server (with Turbopack support)
npm run build            # Production build

# Database
npx prisma studio        # Database browser
npm run seed             # Add sample data (production-safe)
npm run test-db-mode     # Validate database configuration

# Testing
npm run test             # Run full test suite
npm run test:ui          # Interactive test UI
```
